Every time I go on the internet, I see a wealth of content on a diverse range of topics. However, I always notice one general underlying theme: **intense disagreement**. Many people have noticed an rise in polarizing views on the internet; particularly social media and news websites. [Pew Research](https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) has also noticed growing polarization in US politics. What can be done to fix this growing division?

Several sources blame recommendation systems on social media and news sites only suggesting content that aligns with a users personal views sits. [Facebook research](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499?mod=hp_lead_pos5) has investigated (and stopped investigating) divisiveness on its platform, including the effects of their recommendation system on rising polarization amongst users. "Filter bubbles" and "echo chambers" seem to only confirm one's beliefs, leading users to believe their view is unequivocally correct and all others are wrong. However, other studies suggest that that many recommendation systems - in particular those on news websites - actually do suggest diverse opinions to all of it users. One [study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1444076) showed the diversity of opinion suggested to users on an online Dutch news platform. Another [article](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9216) suggests that even with a diverse recommendation of opinions, polarization will continue, and possibly even increase divisiveness. All of these articles reference [confirmation bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias) and stubbornness as an underlying cause for growing polarization. Ultimately, no matter what content users are shown on the internet, it seems unlikely that many will make significant changes to their opinion. This is unfortunate, but not something that is the fault of social media and news websites, rather a common human 

Last Summer, I was looking for an apartment in a new area that I was not familiar with. While looking for apartment complexes, I noticed that all of the reviews were either intensely positive or overwhelmingly negative. After actually visiting several apartments, I found my experience to be... Fine. Just fine. Not great, not terrible. Most importantly: my experience at any of these places was not something I would write a review about online. The star rating distribution from [Yelp statistics](https://www.yelp-press.com/company/fast-facts/default.aspx) also shows that most people only leave a review when they have an extreme opinion of what they are viewing.

One of the takeaways of the classic trolley problem is the tendency to hesitate when action is more involved. More people are willing to flip a switch but refuse to push someone onto the track to save the same amount of lives.

- Who actually posts on a topic?
