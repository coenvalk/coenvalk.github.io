Growing up bilingual, I noticed myself favoring one language over the other in certain scenarios. I've always found hip hop music in English to be more interesting and engaging for me, yet I found slogans and jingles more entertaining in Dutch. This anecdotal evidence only goes so far and I understand this view is rather unique. However, I was curious: are there intrinsic qualities of language that make it good or bad at something? Is there something about the English language that makes it better at producing rap than Dutch? Is there something about Dutch that makes slogans more catchy than those in English?
