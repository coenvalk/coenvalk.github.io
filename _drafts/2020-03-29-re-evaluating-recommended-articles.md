Every day, my news feed is filled to the brim with new articles perfectly tailored to my search and reading history. Or so it should be. Instead, the articles that are recommended to me tend to give me one of these three reactions:

> OK, I looked this up yesterday, but already got the information I needed...

> Wait what!? There's no way that's true!

> Woah, where did this article come from?

Few times - if any - in the past few months do I remember an article being recommended to me that I really  enjoyed reading and felt was correctly tailored to my consistent personal interests. I want to look into this issue and see if there's a way to re-evaluate how article recommendations work.

## Overfit?

> OK, I looked this up yesterday, but already got the information I needed...

I spend a lot of my free time working on coding projects. Often times I find myself in need of some quick info on a specific library or function. Search engines have become so fast that I nearly always find what I'm looking for in just a few short minutes of searching. The story should end there.

Instead, the next morning I get several more articles recommended to me about the information I was looking for and found successfully yesterday. There may be an issue with how quickly topics go from "searched" to "recommended".

The worst offender of this is Amazon product recommendations. I will anywhere from an hour to a few days researching a specific object I want to buy, find the right product for me, buy it, only to be bombarded with more options of the object I already bought and am satisfied with for days later.

## Clickbait!

> Wait what!? There's no way that's true!

I understand.

Viewers on the internet are spoiled. They consistently expect high quality content and don't want to pay for it. I understand a lot of blog and article websites depend on ad revenue from traffic on their site. I understand viewers use ad-blockers so they don't need to see those pesky ads. I understand many people "go incognito" and remove site cookies and caches to read more than the allowed free articles on premium websites (I do it too :sweat_smile:). Click-through rate is an extremely important metric to keep track of when trying to monetize your site or blog.

## "Viewers like you enjoyed..."

> Woah, where did this article come from?

While I like to consider myself a unique individual, I realize 

I have a lot of trouble listening to Spotify recommendations, because when I want to listen to music I typically want a very specific song, album, or artist. 

## Proposal

I would like to see if we can do something about 

### Less Is More

I personally have a relatively short attention span.
