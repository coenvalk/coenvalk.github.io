## Objective

To find a Co-Op for the Summer and Fall of 2019 focusing on back-end software development, data mining, cryptography and security, or machine learning and artificial intelligence. Additionally, gaining experience applying theoretical computer science knowledge to industry standard software development processes, and learn about opportunities for career growth in software development. 

## Github Projects

- [Dyscalculia Test](https://dyscalculiatesting.com/)

  - Creating a math test that sends the user a comprehensive report in pdf form about the test taker’s math level. This project is finished and helps to give information about math deficiencies for people that cannot be tested in person. Follow-up assignment developing an admin panel for client to view statistics on all test takers. Languages used are Javascript, PHP, and MYSQLi. Other software libraries used include fpdf, p5.js, chart.js, and mathjax.

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Current Coursework

- CSCI 4430 - Programming Languages
  - This course is a study of the important concepts found in current programming languages. Topics include language processing (lexical analysis, parsing, type-checking, interpretation and compilation, run-time environment), the role of abstraction (data abstraction and control abstraction), programming paradigms (procedural, functional, object-oriented, logic-oriented, generic), and formal language definition. 
- CSCI 4390 - Data Mining
  - This course will provide an introductory survey of the main topics in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), including: classification, clustering, association rules, sequence mining, similarity search, deviation detection, and so on. Emphasis will be on the algorithmic and system issues in KDD, as well as on applications such as Web mining, multimedia mining, bioinformatics, geographical information systems, etc. 
- CSCI 4230 - Cryptography and Network Security I
  - A self-contained course that includes topics from number theory, basic cryptography, and protocol security. This is a hybrid course with sufficient depth in both theory and hands-on experience with network protocols. Topics include: Classical Cryptography, Block Ciphers (DES, AES), Information Theoretical Cryptography, Randomness, RNG and Stream Ciphers, Hash and MAC Algorithms, Public-Key Cryptography, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Digital Signatures and Identification, Internet Attacks, Web Security, SSL and PGP. 
- PSYC 1200 - General Psychology
  - An introduction to psychology. Topics covered vary with instructor but may include physiological bases of behavior, sensation, perception, learning, memory, child and adult development, motivation, personality, psychological disorders, social behavior.
- ARTS 1440 - Music and Sound I
  - his is the second of the three-course sequence in music theory and aural skills. The course covers the fundamentals of diatonic harmony and two-part species counterpoint. Aural skills include interval, scale and chord identification, rhythmic and tonal solfege, and dictation. Learning activites include weekly assignments in analysis, composition, performance and improvisation, and self-paced use of software in acquisition of aural skills.
