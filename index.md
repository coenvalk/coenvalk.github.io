Hello, I am a Junior computer science major at RPI.
I am the secretary of Partial Credit acapella and the
President of Upsilon chapter of
ΔTΔ fraternity. This is my personal website. Here I
might post projects and other things I'm working on.
Please forgive me if something is up here one day and
is gone the next.

My full resume can be seen <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/symp.csm.usprod/rpi/files/586/586b211b7ca8cba775d20ca30fd7cf78.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
