## Github Projects

- [Dyscalculia Test](https://dyscalculiatesting.com/)

  - Creating a math test that sends the user a comprehensive report in pdf form about the test taker’s math level. This project is finished and helps to give information about math deficiencies for people that cannot be tested in person. Follow-up assignment developing an admin panel for client to view statistics on all test takers. Languages used are Javascript, PHP, and MYSQLi. Other software libraries used include fpdf, p5.js, chart.js, and mathjax.

 - [ConductAR](https://github.com/coenvalk/conductAR)
   - An exciting new in progress project that allows users to conduct infront of a webcam and have music played in real-time. The original idea was to create an interactive installation focusing on music therapy in retirement homes and music participation in museums. Other use cases include real-time conducting for small theatre productions. This project makes use of machine learning to connect hand motion to tempo and dynamics of the music.

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

- [Tabling Schedule](https://github.com/coenvalk/TablingScheduling)

  - A schedule optimizer that takes in groups of people's available schedules and returns a schedule of time slots that caters to everyone's availability in addition to distributing the workload as evenly as possible.

- [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/coenvalk/Collatz-Conjecture)

  - Three programs focusing on visualizing the Collatz Conjecture in C++
    - **Collatz Tree:** Shows numbers branching out following reverse rule.
    - **Collatz Sequence:** Follows one number’s path to one.
    - **Collatz Largest:** Finds the longest Collatz sequence under a given number.

- [Prime Factorization](https://github.com/coenvalk/Prime-Factorization)

  - a prime factorization program that can find the prime factorization of a number and the prime factorizations of all values below a given number written in C.

- [Mastermind](https://github.com/coenvalk/mastermind)

  - Code from a high school project about finding the correct code to a game of mastermind in the fewest amount of moves. The essay associated with the program is [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8CNl_hZHtFzTm5ESzZ0QVRLV0k/view)

- [Simple Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/coenvalk/Simple-Genetic-Algorithm)

  - A genetic algorithm helper class written in C++

## Current Coursework

- CSCI 4320 - Parallel Programming
  - Techniques and methods for parallel programming: models of parallel machines and programs, efficiency and complexity of parallel algorithms. Paradigms of parallel programming and corresponding extensions to sequential programming languages. Overview of parallel languages and coordination languages and models; programming on networks of workstations.

- CSCI 4963 - RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source)
- CSCI 4967 - Economics and Computation
- ECON 4130 - Money & Banking
  - Financial institutions, especially commercial banking and the Federal Reserve System, are considered from three perspectives: their monetary roles; trends in the economic, organizational, and technological aspects of their operations; and their other economic roles-a critical view. Also, the role of money in macroeconomic theory is considered along with the role of monetary policies in relation to the problems of inflation and unemployment.
