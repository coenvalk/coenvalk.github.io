	  A really special day is coming up! I had a lot of fun with my birthday last
	  year, so I thought that I would return the favor! Every clue will
	  lead you to information that will either help you find or answer the next clue.
	  If a clue is too difficult or if you need some guidance, don't hesitate to ask me.

	  <h1>Clue #1</h1>
	  <p>
	    What's this? A clue! Back to the classics! Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, King,
	    the list goes on and on! There's a lot of meaning in those names! Hmmm... I wonder
	    what this initial clue could mean! If all goes according to plan, a word hidden
	    in this initial clue will help you decide what box to open! But before you open it,
	    be sure to talk with me to make sure you're correct!
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div id="clue2">
	  <h1>Clue #2</h1>
	  <p>
	    Good work! The box with the code word "SHACK" on it should be opened! Unfortunately,
	    this clue didn't work out so well :(. I tried making a secret language with symbols,
	    but I got the letters and symbols all mixed up!!! Hopefully you will be still able to
	    make some sense out of it! Inside the box are some slips of paper that will help you
	    decifer the following secret message to letters... I'm sure someone named <u>Caesar</u>
	    will be able to help you from there!
	  </p>
