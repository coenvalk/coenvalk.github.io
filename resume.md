## Github Projects

- [CondenseMyTalk](https://github.com/coenvalk/condensemytalk)
  - Automatic video lecture summaries based on crowd-sourced voting, keyword search, and audio transcript summary.
  - Made with Python, NLTK, and the Google Cloud Speech-to-text API.
  - Ranked in top 15 hacks out of 53 submissions entered at HackRPI 2019 hackathon.
- [Dyscalculia Test](https://dyscalculiatesting.com/)
  - Creating a math test that sends the user a comprehensive report in pdf form about the test taker’s math level. This project is finished and helps to give information about math deficiencies for people that cannot be tested in person. Follow-up assignment developing an admin panel for client to view statistics on all test takers. Languages used are Javascript, PHP, and MYSQLi. Other software libraries used include fpdf, p5.js, chart.js, and mathjax.
 - [ConductAR](https://github.com/coenvalk/conductAR)
   - An exciting new in progress project that allows users to conduct infront of a webcam and have music played in real-time. The original idea was to create an interactive installation focusing on music therapy in retirement homes and music participation in museums. Other use cases include real-time conducting for small theatre productions. This project makes use of machine learning to connect hand motion to tempo and dynamics of the music.
