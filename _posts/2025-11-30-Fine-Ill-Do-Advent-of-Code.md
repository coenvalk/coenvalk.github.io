I've considered participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in
the past few years. I started a couple of the problems, but never took it very
seriously. This year the Advent of Code made a couple changes that make it a bit
more accessible:

1. **Only 12 days of problems instead of 25:** This makes it much easier to fit
   into my busy December schedule visiting family and
   [holiday shows](https://northwestsound.org).
1. **No public leaderboard:** That way I don't get too worked up about how long
   it takes me to finish part 2 of each problem.

In the past, I've attempted the Advent of Code problems in Rust. I'm a huge fan
of Rust, and enjoy using it to write my ML framework
[rs-ml]({% link _projects/rs-ml.md %}). However, the "quick and dirty" nature of
these one-off questions does not fit well into Rust's philosophy, so I end up
spending more time fighting the borrow checker than actually solving the
problem. This year, I'll be taking the opportunity to learn
[Go](https://go.dev). I've heard lots of good things about Go, notably quick
compilation and simple syntax; two commonly complained about pain points of
Rust. My primary goal is to have a basic grasp of Golang by the end of the 12
days of code. By writing this I'm keeping myself accountable to share my
progress and what I learned about Go after the 12 days are up. Maybe I'll be
able to add a new language to my [toolbelt]({% link _pages/resume.md %})!
