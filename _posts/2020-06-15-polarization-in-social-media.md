Every time I go on the internet, I always notice one general underlying theme: **intense disagreement**. Many people have noticed a rise in polarizing views on the internet; particularly on social media and news websites. [Pew Research](https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) has also noticed growing polarization in US politics. Where is this divide coming from?

Several sources blame [recommendation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) on social media and news sites only suggesting content that aligns with a user's personal views. [Facebook research](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499?mod=hp_lead_pos5) has investigated (and stopped investigating) divisiveness on its platform, including the effects of their recommendation system on rising polarization amongst users. "Filter bubbles" and "echo chambers" seem to only confirm one's beliefs, leading users to believe their view is unequivocally correct and all others are wrong. However, other studies suggest that that many recommendation systems - in particular those on news websites - actually do suggest diverse opinions to all of its users. One [study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1444076) showed the diversity of opinion suggested to users on an online Dutch news platform. Another [article](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9216) suggests that even with a diverse recommendation of opinions, polarization will continue, and possibly even increase divisiveness. I believe that [confirmation bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias) is an underlying cause for growing polarization. Ultimately, no matter what content users are shown on the internet, it seems unlikely that many will make significant changes to their opinion and in some cases may only deepen their personal beliefs more. This is unfortunate, but not something that is the fault of social media and news websites, rather a common human trait that is highlighted particularly clearly on the internet.

Last Summer, I was looking for an apartment in a new area that I was not familiar with. While looking for apartment complexes, I noticed that all of the reviews were either intensely positive or overwhelmingly negative. After actually visiting several apartments, I found my experience to be... Fine. Just fine. Not great, not terrible. Most importantly: my experience at any of these places was not something I would write a review about online. The star rating distribution from [Yelp statistics](https://www.yelp-press.com/company/fast-facts/default.aspx) also shows that most people only leave a review when they have an extreme opinion of what they are consuming. Similarly, users tend to only post when they are particularly invested in a topic, causing only heated and possibly polarized opinions being overrepresented on social media. The overrepresentation of extreme opinions may contribute to perceived growing polarization in the United States.

One of the takeaways of the classic trolley problem is the tendency to hesitate when the action is more involved. More people are willing to flip a switch from far away and sacrifice a life but refuse to push someone onto the track to save the same amount of lives. On the internet, it may be easier to express an extreme idea - even one that may be controversial or hurtful - when protected and distanced by anonymity. Particularly on internet forums where it is possible to post without making a profile, users can feel free to post whatever they wish and feel less accountable for the implications of expressing their view. This freedom can give users the courage to post more divisive opinions which they would feel less comfortable expressing in person.

So what can be done to promote healthy discussion on the internet and decrease polarization? Interestingly, I believe that the best thing one can do to promote healthy discussion is post more often on a wide range of topics - even on those which you do not have a strong opinion on. I believe this may help decrease polarization in a few ways:

- [Sentiment Analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) on internet platforms can get a more accurate idea of the general public's view on a topic
- Recommendation systems have more moderately opinionated content to recommend to users which may promote more thoughtful discussion rather than dismissal of opinions so far from their own.
- Inform yourself through listening to the reactions of others.

Polarizing opinions and intense disagreement can be quite jarring, and without some changes to users' posting habits this current downward spiral will continue, until fewer and fewer people even want to engage with each other over a particular platform, causing it to fade away like so many other past social media platforms. Social media is still rather new, and humanity has had little time to adjust to the wide range of both positive and negative possibilities that social media can provide, and how to make the most productive use of the internet as a platform for informed, reasonable discussion.
