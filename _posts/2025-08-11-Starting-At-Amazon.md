  Exploring exciting new opportunities in my software engineering career at
  Amazon!

July 25th, 2025 was my last day as an applied data scientist at Microsoft.
August 11th, 2025 is my first day as a software engineer at Amazon. It is by far
the largest change in my career. Nearly everything about my day-to-day will
change, including but not limited to:

- **Company change:** Microsoft -> Amazon
- **Discipline change:** applied data science -> software engineering
- **Divisional change:** cybersecurity -> operations and logistics
- **Communication change:** Teams -> Slack & Zoom
- **Workflow change:** Windows OS -> MacOS

I can't lie: I'm a little nervous. I've spent the past five years working at
Microsoft and at this point am very familiar with the practices, rhythm of
business and lingo. Amazon has its own completely different set of business
practices and
[lingo](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)
that I'll have to get used to.

That said, I'm also very excited by the opportunity to learn, share expertise
from my own career experience, and grow my network. I've been fortunate enough
to briefly meet some members of the team already. They seem like a great group
of people and a brilliant team of engineers.

While a lot will be different, much will also feel familiar. I learned from a
meet-and-greet chat that the engineering team works closely with a data science
team. I have a good opportunity to be a bridge between the teams due to my
experience in both disciplines. While I'm not fully familiar with the AWS
versions of services, I'm very familiar with the Azure cloud equivalents as well
as the frameworks the team uses.

All-in-all, I must remind myself to use my nervous-excitement as fuel to learn
all I can and make a great contribution to my new team.
