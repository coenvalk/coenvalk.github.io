I am a young software engineering professional based in Redmond, Washington. I spend the majority of my personal time singing and making music.

I sing with [Northwest Sound Men's Chorus](https://northwestsound.org/) and the [Seattle Symphony Chorale](https://www.seattlesymphony.org/chorale). I volunteer with [Motley Zoo Animal Rescue](https://www.motleyzooanimalrescue.org/).
