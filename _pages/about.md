I am a software engineer and data scientist based in Redmond, Washington. I spend the majority of my personal time singing and making music.

I sing with [Northwest Sound Men's Chorus](https://northwestsound.org/). I support the following local organizations with both my time and donations:

- [Motley Zoo Animal Rescue](https://www.motleyzooanimalrescue.org/)
- [Hopelink](https://www.hopelink.org/)
- [The Whole Cat and Kaboodle](https://www.wholecatandkaboodle.com/)
- [Oranjeschool](https://www.oranjeschool.org/)
