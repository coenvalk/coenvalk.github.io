  - Creating a math test that sends the user a comprehensive report in pdf form about the test taker’s math level. This project is finished and helps to give information about math deficiencies for people that cannot be tested in person. Follow-up assignment developing an admin panel for client to view statistics on all test takers. Languages used are Javascript, PHP, and MYSQLi. Other software libraries used include fpdf, p5.js, chart.js, and mathjax.
